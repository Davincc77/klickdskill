# `docs/rfcs/chimera/packs/` — concrete `x.klickd/<pack>` scaffolds

> **Status:** Draft · NON-NORMATIVE · scaffolds only.
> **Track:** `.klickd v4.1` Chimera (see [RFC-009](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md)).
> **Triggers no release.** No schema, no SDK, no tag, no `latest` on npm/PyPI, **no Zenodo DOI**, no IANA action, no `klickd-ai/site` change.

This directory is where concrete per-pack specs live. They are **scaffolds**, not catalogs: each file describes the **shape** of one `x.klickd/<pack>`, exercises the carrier-vs-skill rule ([RFC-009 §5.1.1](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md)), and lists what is missing before the pack is real.

> "Companion host skill" is the **method** the LLM / agent applies *on top of* the pack. It is **not** part of the pack. See [RFC-009 §5.1.1](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md) and `student.md` §3 for what is forbidden inside a pack.

## 2. The two architectural rules

### 2.1 Carrier-vs-skill (Rule 1)

> **Packs carry state. Hosts carry skill.**
>
> A pack describes what the carrier *is* in a domain (learner, developer, researcher, …). The matching pedagogy / method / behaviour (how to *teach*, *review*, *prosecute*, *coach*) is loaded host-side as a Klickd/Kai skill, never embedded in the pack.

This separation is what makes packs portable across hosts and what lets pedagogy improve without touching user files.

### 2.2 v4.1-native, no legacy adapter (Rule 2)

> **Packs are authored from authoritative frameworks, not adapted from v4-preview personas.**

No `knowledge.mastered[]`, no `mastered_topics[]`, no narrative `level` strings, no implicit `persona → pack` migration. Personas under `examples/v4/personas/` stay v4-preview anchors per [RFC-009 §5.0 / §6](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md).

## 3. Validation criteria

A scaffold becomes a **real** pack only after satisfying all **ten** criteria of [RFC-009 §8](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md):

1. Framework anchor (SKOS/JSON-LD into ESCO / WEF / O\*NET).
2. Gates declared (RFC-002 defaults + veto posture).
3. Evidence rules (RFC-002 §8b claim grounding).
4. No PII (publisher-owned, not user-owned).
5. Round-trip safe with v4.0-only readers.
6. Offline-resolvable (SKOS subset bundled).
7. Router-priceable (deterministic token-cost estimate).
8. Human-authority preserved (no pack default lowers user v4.0 gate).
9. No persona reuse (`examples/v4/personas/*` files stay anchors).
10. Carrier-vs-skill separation (no method / pedagogy / prompting / scoring rubric / intervention policy in the pack).

A scaffold that satisfies the rule and the shape but lacks the resolved framework refs, the SKOS bundle, the cost estimate, or the offline-resolvable subset is **not** a real pack. The `student.md` scaffold is in that state today: shape and both rules are clean; substance (real ESCO/EQF/DigComp IRIs, SKOS offline bundle, router-cost row) is explicitly TODO.

For the v4.1-native shape contract (top-level fields, types, required, framework anchoring, frozen `forbidden_fields` list), see [RFC-009 §8.1](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md). A candidate pack is reviewed against that table.

## 4. The no-fake-catalog rule (explicit)

> **Until a pack passes all ten validation criteria, it MUST NOT be exposed as a download, listing, or catalog entry.**

Concretely, **none** of the following are permitted by this RFC:

- Serving `examples/v4/personas/*.klickd` (or any v4 fixture) as a "competency pack" under `/klickdskill`, `klickd.app/catalog`, or any other surface. Those files are non-normative v4-preview personas and stay so. (See [`examples/v4/personas/README.md`](../../../../examples/v4/personas/README.md).)
- Renaming, repackaging, or aggregating existing fixtures and labelling them `x.klickd/<pack>`.
- Standing up a `/klickdskill` listing page, search index, or API endpoint for "competency packs" before P0 packs satisfy §8.
- Publishing a pack-bundle artefact to npm / PyPI / a public registry with `latest` or `next` channels.
- Depositing any pack to Zenodo or assigning a DOI.
- Adding any pack-related entry to IANA.

These prohibitions are **architectural**, not merely procedural: a fake catalog locks the taxonomy before reviewers can audit it, and the cost of unwinding a published taxonomy is far higher than the cost of waiting.

## 5. Notes for `/klickdskill` (later, not now)

When P0 validation eventually passes, **and only then**, a `/klickdskill` catalog surface MAY be considered. The expected shape, sketched here so reviewers can disagree early:

- One entry per pack, never per persona.
- Each entry links to the canonical pack spec under `docs/rfcs/chimera/packs/<pack>.md`.
- Each entry exposes the pack's framework anchors (ESCO / WEF / O\*NET IRIs), gate defaults, and router-cost estimate (RFC-003 row).
- Each entry MUST NOT bundle user PII. Packs are publisher-owned.
- Each entry MUST be versioned independently of `.klickd` itself; bumping the format does not bump every pack.
- Anchor personas (`01-eleve-terminale-fr`, …) remain **separate** v4-preview fixtures; they MUST NOT appear in the catalog as packs.
- No DOI / Zenodo deposit is implied by catalog presence.

These are notes, not commitments. The first real catalog decision is gated by P0 packs passing §8.

## 6. Persona anchors are anchors

Current v4 personas live at [`examples/v4/personas/`](../../../../examples/v4/personas/) and are non-normative. The mapping to future packs is documented in [RFC-009 §6](../../RFC-009-chimera-v4.1.md):

| Persona (anchor only) | Future pack |
|---|---|
| `01-eleve-terminale-fr` | `x.klickd/student` |
| `02-chef-projet-pme-fr` | `x.klickd/work` |
| `03-fullstack-developer-en` | `x.klickd/coding` |
| `04-createur-media-fr` | `x.klickd/creator` |
| `05-rpg-gamer-en` | `x.klickd/gaming` |
| `student-multi-provider` | `x.klickd/bridge` |

Anchor ≠ pack. A pack is built **from authoritative frameworks**, not from a renamed persona.
